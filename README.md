# PWA Roadshow 10/22

## Keynote
- All about building radically better UI/UX
- FIRE: Fast, integrated, reliable, engaging
  - Fast
    - Time is money -> After 3 seconds of load, 20% of users bounce
    - 53% of users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load
  - Integrated
    - Users should be able to interact with site the same way as any app
  - Reliable
    - Experience should be consistent even if there is no network connection
    - "reliability means never showing the Downasaur"
  - Engaging
    - whole experience is delightful - web push API
    - push notifications turn occasional users into daily users
    - Twitter Lite -> launches into fullscreen app...even though it's just mobile web
- Reaching emerging markets -> PWA is 0.6 MB compared to 26MB Android app
- All possible because of service workers!
  - client-side JavaScript proxy
- PWA: Not everything works everywhere yet, but UX is key. Focusing on end-to-end experience dramatically impacts experience for everyone, no matter what their device supports
- Three ways to PWA-ify
  - From the ground up
  - A simpler/stripped-down version
  - A single feature

## Integrated Experience
- Manifest file
  - `/manifest.json`
    - name
    - short_name
    - start_url
    - display: standalone (hides address bar, just like a native app)
    - icons
    - colors -> background_color, theme_color
-
